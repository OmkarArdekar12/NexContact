# NexContact

NexContact is a simple Contact Manager application built with Next.js that allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal and professional contacts efficiently. The application supports session-based authentication and full CRUD operations on contacts using a clean, responsive user interface. For rapid development and demonstration purposes, json-server is used as a mock backend to simulate RESTful APIs, with the architecture designed to be easily extendable to a real backend in the future.
